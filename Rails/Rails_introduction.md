# Ruby on Rails
- Rails is a web application development framework written in Ruby.

## Rails way
- **Don't repeat yourself**: maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.
- **Convention Over Configuration**: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify endless configuration files.

## Rails features
### [Rails CLI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html)

## Architecture
- Rails uses Model-View-Controller(MVC) architectural pattern in order to improve the maintainability of the application.

- Represented as a table in database.
- supported by [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rorlab.org/active_record_basics.html).
